        <a class = "content_text">So Particly wasn`t an idea from me, but from one of my friends. But now me and 4 others are working on it 
            Generally, it can be said that Particly is an app for planning your parties. But it is also way more than that. You will also be able to promote your party, find other parties, chat with your friends, or share photos with everybody else. 
        </a>
        <a class = "content_h2">Which technologies are we using?</a>
        <a class = "content_text">Well, if you talk about technologies you got to talk about frontend. We decided to just stick to the basic and us simple web technologies, since we didn't want to learn a completely new framework, before starting. We decided to stick to web technologies, since writing multiple apps for different OSs, didn't sit right with us. Writing in HTML CCS JS, we can compile for apple, android and all other OSs, using Capacitors. </a>
        <a class = "content_h2">When will it be released?</a>  
        <a class = "content_text">We think the beta could be rolled out in summer.</a>
