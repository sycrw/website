                <a class="Skills_txt">Creating my own website was one of my bigger goals when I started to get into
                    programming. After watching a YouTube tutorial I actually built a very basic
                    website but I was overwhelmed and lost motivation. After a while I got back
                    into it because a friend and me were planning to create a small social media
                    app. This app never came into existence but it provided motivation to start
                    doing more in basic HTML, CSS and JS. Shortly after I was approached by a
                    friend who was planning to start “Particly”. This was a genuinely nice &quot;full
                    circle&quot; moment, since I recognized, that learning to code had somewhat paid
                    off. And yes, fun fact, Particly is built with plain web technologies. For more
                    information about Particly you can check it out in the project tab.</a>

                <a class="Skills_txt">Discord.JS is a Node.JS library for discord bots. This came into my mind when I
                    wanted to make a discord bot for the Particly website to improve the workflow.
                    For example, I wanted to be able to access ChatGPT from discord, but after I
                    found out, that the APIs were not generally accessible, I switched and started
                    to make a game bot. More about that game bot you can find in my github, or in
                    the project tab.</a>

                    Unity was my first real experience with programming. I had worked with
                    Scratch, because my Uncle gave me a Scratch and Python book, but I never
                    reached the Python section but anyways. One day I was sitting at home during
                    lockdown and was bored out of my mind, so I decided to learn how to create a

                    game. The first YouTube video that popped up was the &quot;How to make a game&quot;
                    Series from “Brackeys”, so I followed it. This really sparked my love for
                    programming as I saw what could be created and imagined the endless
                    possibilities in this field. So, I built a few games with Unity and the C# language.
                    While creating this page I went to find my old games, sadly they were all
                    corrupted. To have some Unity project on the site I programmed my first game
                    with unity &quot;Hexagame&quot; again, which you can find in the projects tab. It really
                    brought a lot of joy and good memories.

                    was the first real backend language I learned, and I really enjoy it. Also, the
                    feeling of operating your first server is just great.</a>

                    <a class="Skills_txt">Arch is my daily OS. So why am I not using Windows, like everybody else? Well
                        first of all I found Windows has just transformed into a huge and complex
                        solution, that needs a lot of RAM . So, a friend(<div
                            onclick="openHarald()" style="display: inline; text-decoration: underline;cursor: pointer;">
                            Luis</div>)told me, how little ram his Linux
                            laptop was using in idle. I noticed this was 1/8th of what my windows PC was
                            using, so I understood that something had to be done. I installed Debian with
                            xfce and was surprised by the control I had gained. My PC didn’t take years to
                            boot up and everything was so clean. Of course, the first few weeks were
                            different, but knowing that I am get used to it. I can confidently say that I only
                            use Windows to do GPU intensive things. Plus, Linux just improves my
                            workflow and boosts my productivity, since everything is so quickly accessible
                            through the terminal. A few months after my friend introduced me to Linux, I
                            noticed, that the GNOME desktop environment is very clean. So I tried to install
                            it, but found out, that a lot of applications came with it and that was just too
                            much. It also compromised the reason I switched to Linux. I wanted to get rid
                            of the bloat. But after some more discussion and research I learned that found
                            out that while installing arch, you could choose to not install all of these
                            
                            applications. This was great, plus it was a major breath of fresh air, escaping
                            Debian’s repositories and using arch user repos. Since then, I have been on
                            Arch Linux.</a>

                        thankful that I had spent some time there, since most of the world’s
                        servers run on Debian. Exactly like the servers my friend and me  set up
                        in our school also running on Debian. Therefore, this was easy on the
                        PC side. It also provided an important step-stone from Windows to Arch.
                        Without it I would have probably stepped back into Windows “hell.” </a>
