After whatching a youtube tutorial i actually biuld a very basic website, but was overwhelmed and lost motivation. After a while i got back into, because me and a friend were planing to make a small social media app. This app never came into existince but it gave me motivation to start doing more in basic html css and js. After this i was approched by my friend who was planing to start particly. This was a very nice "full cirlce" moment, since i saw that learning this had somewhat payed of. And yes fun fact Particly is biuld with plain web thechnologies. For more towards Particly you can check i tout in the projects tab.</a>

For example I wanted to be able to access chat gpt from discord, but after i found out that the apis were not generaly accasable, i switched and started to make a game bot. More about that game bot you can find in my github, or in the projects tab.</a>

I had expirimented with Scratch, because my Uncle gave my a Sratch and paython book, but i never reacht the python section. but anyways, one day i was sitting at home during lockdown and was bored out of my mind, so i decided how to learn how to make a game. The first youtube video that pop up was the "How to make a game" Series from brackeys, so i followed it. This really sparked my love for programming as i saw what could be created and imagined the endless posibilitys. So i went on to biuld a few games with Unity and the C' language. But after some time i moved away from it. While creating thi spage i went to find my old games, sadly they were all corrupted. So to have some Unity project in the site a reprogrammed my first game with unity "hexagame", which you can find in the projects tab. It really brought up much joy and good memories.   </a>

                        Well first of all i find windows has just transformed into a bloated mess. So a friend(<div onclick="openHarald()" style="display: inline; text-decoration: underline;cursor: pointer;">Luis</div>) told 
                    me, how little ram his linux laptop was using in idle. I noticed this was 1/8th of what my 
                    windows PC was using, so i knew that something had to be done. I istalled debian with xfce 
                    and was supriesed by the control i hade. My Pc didnt take years to boot up and everything 
                    was so clean. Of course the first few weeks were different, but know that i am used to it i
                     can confidently say, that i only use Windows to do GPU intesive things. Plus Linux just 
                     improves my workflow and boosts my productivity, since everthing is so quickly accesible 
                     trough the terminal. A few month after my friend introduced me to linux, i saw that he was 
                     using GNOME and i found that destop enviorment very very clean. So i tried to install it but
                      noticed, that a lot of applications came with it and that was just to much. It also compromised 
                      the reason why i switched to linux. I wanted to get rid of the bloat. But after some more discuission
                       and research with my <div onclick="openHarald()" style="display: inline; text-decoration: underline;cursor: pointer;">friend</div> we found out that while installing arch, you could chosse to not install 
                       all of these applications. This was great, puls it was a major breath of fresh air, escaping debians 
                       reposotorys and using archs user repos. Since then i have been on Arch Linux.    </a>

                        run on debian. Exactly like thes servers me and <div onclick="openHarald()" style="display: inline; text-decoration: underline;cursor: pointer;">Luis</div> set up some servers in our school also 
                        running on debian. Therfore this was farly easy on the PC side. It also provided a important 
                        stepping stone from Windows to Arch. With out it i would have probably fallend back into windows hell.  </a>
